Multiplier VHDL to assemmbly code notes!

-code to cpp first, since I think using classes to build the subcircuits would
	be somewhat helpful to understand how i should convert into assembly...

-maybe even choose to link a cpp file to assembly..? that way there is assembly to build or used 
	the circuit..?
