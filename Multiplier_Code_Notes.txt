Multiplier VHDL to assemmbly code notes!

-code to cpp first, since I think using classes to build the subcircuits would
	be somewhat helpful to understand how i should convert into assembly...

-maybe even choose to link a cpp file to assembly..? that way there is assembly to build or used 
	the circuit..?

- in the cpp conversion from vhdl, is there a better way to intput the binary numbers rather than 
	in the form of integers? (note M and Q taken by void multiplier....)
	--> idea 1: could do an integer vector of some kind...
			--this would more than likely be difficult to impliment if allowing a user to input
				values.... 
	--> idea 2: simply make it known that hey, pls insert a 4 piece integer...?
			--then how will this be looked at???
	--> what I'm going to try:
		> Array/vector like I did in VHDL (M[0]-M[3], etc...this is shown in VHDL through 
			std_logic_vector(topval DOWNTO bottomval)
			-need to refresh how to do this in a function though....
