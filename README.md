# CS301_Project

#Goal

My goal for my project, is to create a bit multiplier using x86 assembly, which has been covered in class. In order to perform this, I hope to take some VHDL code that I have from my EE243 (Digital Logic) class which displays the types of logic gates required to multiply two four bit values together, and gradually transform them into a form of assembly that works in the same manner.
