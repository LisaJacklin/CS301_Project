;assembly bit multiplier


;so below I have a selection of different jumps/pointer sections for different pieces needed
;WHAT TO CHECK! if I do it this way, will it run back to the code placement? (blieve this is a no...)

;first thing I know I can do is setting register(s) for input values.
;review and see if I should input all 4 bits into a single register or not.... can I parce a register?
mov rdx, 0000 ;for the moment, lets say this is M(4-0) 
mov rcx, 0000 ;and this is Q(4-0)

mov rax, 0 ;this is the grounding piece within the circuit...(so rax is what will be push/popped)
;through all of these functions is my initial thought...)



section .data ; check if it should be .data.....
adder:
	

TopRow:
SecondRow:
ResultRow:


;note that the disassembly code is being used as inspiration/reference
;with the hope that it will point me in the correct direction.....
